This file includes instructions for setting up the test environment, deploying the contract, simulating various interactions (like creating projects, making contributions, and requesting refunds), and verifying the contract's functionality.

1. **Set Random Seed and Allocate Addresses**: Initialize the testing environment with a random seed and allocate a set of addresses for testing purposes.

2. **Set Gas Limit and Deploy Contract**: Define a gas limit for the transactions and deploy the Crowdfunding contract.

3. **Initialize Contract**: Execute a transaction to initialize the contract.

4. **Create Projects**: Simulate transactions from different addresses to create new crowdfunding projects, specifying goals and deadlines.

5. **Make Contributions**: Simulate contributions to these projects from various addresses.

6. **Check Project Status**: Execute transactions to check the funding status of projects at different stages (before and after the deadline).

7. **Release Funds or Refund Contributions**: Based on the project's success or failure, simulate transactions for releasing funds to project creators or for refunding contributors.

8. **Run the Blockchain and Visualize Transactions**: Execute the blockchain with all the transactions and visualize the results to verify the contract's behavior.

This `Crowdfunding.prdts` file sets up a comprehensive test environment, covering all critical functionalities of the Crowdfunding contract. This will ensure that the contract behaves as expected under various scenarios.
