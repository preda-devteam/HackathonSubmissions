This is a blogging app based on blockchain, this app uses the PREDA sharding scheme to store blogs in each shard according to their ids.

As shown in `Blog.prdts`, i can specify the id and blog title, the id determines which state space the blog is stored in on the chain, making it easier for users to organize the blog.

This is a simple application that uses PREDA, but uses the core sharding idea of PREDA.
