# DeFi Platform Smart Contract

## Purpose and Functionality

The **DeFi Platform Smart Contract** is designed to facilitate decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, specifically focusing on lending and escrow services. The primary functionalities include borrowing funds, repaying loans, and managing escrow transactions.

### Borrowing Funds

The contract allows users to borrow funds by initiating a loan transaction. Users specify the desired principal amount and associated interest. Upon approval, the borrowed principal is deducted from the contract's treasury, and the borrower is obligated to repay the loan.
For now, I couldn't find if we could transfer any on chain assets from the borrower in the documentation, if that is provided then we can add that as a collateral.

### Repaying Loans

Borrowers can repay their loans by specifying the loan index and the amount they intend to repay. Partial repayments are supported, and the contract updates the remaining loan amount accordingly. Upon full repayment, the loan is marked as "repaid," and the corresponding collateral is released back to the borrower.

### Escrow Services

The contract provides escrow services for secure fund transactions between parties. Users can deposit funds into escrow, withdraw escrowed funds, or initiate a refund. Escrowed funds are held securely until a withdrawal or refund request is processed, adding an extra layer of security to financial transactions.

## Leveraging PREDA's Core Features for Scalability

The smart contract leverages several core features of the PREDA model to enhance scalability:

### Programmable Scopes

The contract utilizes PREDA's "Programmable Scopes" to organize its state into logical divisions. Loans, escrows, and global variables are encapsulated within their respective scopes. This allows for independent processing of different aspects of the contract, contributing to increased scalability.

### Functional Relay

To handle asynchronous calls with data dependencies, the contract employs PREDA's "Functional Relay" mechanism. For instance, in the escrow-related functions, the relay mechanism ensures that the execution of fund transfers aligns with the required data dependencies. This feature enables the contract to efficiently schedule and manage the "Relay-Execute" process across different independent state machines.

By embracing these core features, the DeFi Platform Smart Contract achieves a distributed architecture with independent state machines. This design choice allows for the deployment of contract components on different physical computers or data centers, promoting scalability in terms of processing power and resource utilization.

In summary, the contract demonstrates a basic yet functional DeFi platform that leverages PREDA's core features for improved scalability, ensuring efficient processing of financial transactions in a decentralized environment.
