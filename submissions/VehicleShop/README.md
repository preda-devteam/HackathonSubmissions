I was thinking about what to do, how to implement
so I decided to do VehicleShop contract. 
Vehicle contract has global property for name. VehicleShop has mapping of vehicles and every vehicle has its own address. Every vehicle have shards of services. 
History is also added because I wanted to add the example of using interfaces. What I wanted is to use global/address/shard/interface as use cases
